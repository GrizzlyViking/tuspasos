        <div class="col-md-12"><p>Hi there Fabi… just a few words of thanks for your sheer professionalism,  combined with quiet calming soothing manner,
        and emphatic nature, that seals you, as someone at the very top of your chosen career path.  I don’t have enough words to
        describe how wonderful it feels, to have the luxury of one your treatments … suffice to say, that every penny is well spent, to
        enjoy the sheer luxury of contentment that my body, and mind feels, when I leave your salon.   If anyone is any doubt how
        therapeutic it is to have one of your treatments, then all they have to do, is ask me. <b class="turquoise">Manuela</b></p>


        <p>I first met Fabi when I was offered a Reflexology taster, at my regular well being clinic. As I have had Reflexology before, I
        thought I knew what to expect. But was I in for a pleasant experience. Fabi straight away put me at ease. I firstly was asked
        about my condition, I was not rushed at all, from start to finish it was calming, relaxing and all that mattered was what was
        happening in the treatment room, not family worries etc. I have to say Fabi is brilliant, kind caring lady. From that day on I
        have never looked back.Fabi has worked miracles with me. I have pain twenty four seven and I have learnt to live with that.
        But after treatments with Fabi, I sleep much better, I'm more relaxed, I cope with my moods better and cope with my pain etc.
        Which is marvellous. Life is more bearable. So I can not thank Fabi enough. She is an amazingly knowledgeable, caring lady.
        Always putting the person first and listens to everything you have to say. So if you have a chance to have treatment like I did
        take it because I can assure you that you will never look back.So that you Fabi.  <b class="turquoise">Lesley</b></p>


        <p>Fabi was recommended to me by a friend about 6 months ago, as I have suffered for many years with back pain and aching
        muscles.  From the first treatment I have never looked back and I receive a treatment once a week.  After the treatments I feel
        great and am able to manage my back problem much better.  I can throughly recommend reflexology and in particular Fabi.

        <p>A friend suggested trying reflexology with Fabi at Tus Pasos for relaxation and pain relief and having suffered an injury and also chronic depression for many years, I decided I had nothing to lose by trying it.
            I will be eternally grateful to that friend !! Fabi is an amazing lady, she radiates warmth, calm and tranquility. Her pleasant manner immediately puts you at ease.
            As Fabi applied gentle but firm pressure to the whole foot I became aware that I could feel a heat rising from my feet up towrads my head and a sense of peacefulness spreading through my whole being.
            An awareness of being somewhere but being there without any stress continued to circulate throughout my body and with each breath a little more pressure seemed to leave me.
            At the end of this bespoke treatment I felt warm and comfortable and amazed that I had finally experienced a deeply relaxed state.
            In the days following the treatment I have noticed being able to move more freely and with a little less pain on occasions.
            Fabi is a skilled reflexologist and having discovered the potent effects of her treatments I have booked more with her. Thanks Fabi. <b class="turquoise">Cheryl</b></p></div>

	I started going for reflexology because my feet and legs were swollen and painful due to lymphoedema. She had to work very lightly on me because of the pain. After my second treatment my lower leg was measured again and I had lost 2 1/2" inches which has not come back (that was a bonus). I am now walking better than I have for a long time. I would recommend reflexology, it really does work and is very relaxing, I also sleep better. Thank you Fabi. <b class="turquise">Daisy</b>

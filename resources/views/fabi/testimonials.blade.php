        <p>Hi there Fabi… just a few words of thanks for your sheer professionalism,  combined with quiet calming soothing manner, a
        nd emphatic nature, that seals you, as someone at the very top of your chosen career path.  I don’t have enough words to
        describe how wonderful it feels, to have the luxury of one your treatments … suffice to say, that every penny is well spent, to
        enjoy the sheer luxury of contentment that my body, and mind feels, when I leave your salon.   If anyone is any doubt how
        therapeutic it is to have one of your treatments, then all they have to do, is ask me. <b class="turquoise">Manuela</b></p>


        <p>I first met Fabi when I was offered a Reflexology taster, at my regular well being clinic. As I have had Reflexology before, I
        thought I knew what to expect. But was I in for a pleasant experience. Fabi straight away put me at ease. I firstly was asked
        about my condition, I was not rushed at all, from start to finish it was calming, relaxing and all that mattered was what was
        happening in the treatment room, not family worries etc. I have to say Fabi is brilliant, kind caring lady. From that day on I
        have never looked back.Fabi has worked miracles with me. I have pain twenty four seven and I have learnt to live with that.
        But after treatments with Fabi, I sleep much better, I'm more relaxed, I cope with my moods better and cope with my pain etc.
        Which is marvellous. Life is more bearable. So I can not thank Fabi enough. She is an amazingly knowledgeable, caring lady.
        Always putting the person first and listens to everything you have to say. So if you have a chance to have treatment like I did
        take it because I can assure you that you will never look back.So that you Fabi.  <b class="turquoise">Lesley</b></p>


        <p>Fabi was recommended to me by a friend about 6 months ago, as I have suffered for many years with back pain and aching
        muscles.  From the first treatment I have never looked back and I receive a treatment once a week.  After the treatments I feel
        great and am able to manage my back problem much better.  I can throughly recommend reflexology and in particular Fabi.
